# impedance_tuby_py
Software to control a low-cost impedance tube to measure acoustic parameters according to ISO 10534-2. It is still not finished, so don't rely on the results yet!

It is my first python and my first Qt project, so if you have suggestions for improvement I would be really glad to hear about this.

Documentation is not yet written, but will be in the near future as part of a university project.

The Interface is still a mix of German and English. Not really beautiful. Many inconsistencies. But the technical Aspect (receiving correct measurements) is more important to me for now.
